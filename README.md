# CodeHub

Deep down every single person has a creative side, and sometimes we need a little burst of inspiration. 
CodeHub is the number one website to not only obtain that inspiration boost but to post your own coding projects and inspire others!

---- How it works ----

CodeHub users can sign up and create their own account where they can post their own coding projects, view the community home page, and even follow and like others' projects.

And if you don't feel like creating an account and signing up, you're more than welcome to view the community home page where you can see the highest-rated coding projects at that time.

Oh and for those that have absolutely zero interest in coding projects you are more than welcome to play around with the interactive floating icon CSS background (trust me, itâ€™s quite fun)
